//Variables must have a Type, Name, and Data

//INT (Whole Numbers)
// For example if we are storing an int (a whole number) we would write it like the following
//-- int iAmANumber = 5; --//
// This example stores the type of data (Int) the name of the variable, and the number itself. 


//FLOATs (Decimals)
// Floats are used to store numbers with additional numbers after a decimal.
// as we know, writing functions in C# asks for a type, name and data type. So we could write this like:
//-- float pi = 3.1415 --//

//BOOL (True false)
// Bools are true false statements
// an example of how this is written is as follows
//-- bool isGPSEnabled = true; --//

//STRING (Written words) 
//String is written words, Note that strings take more memory than a char 
//-- string myName = "Aszalea"

//Char (characters)
//This is used to store special characters, use this if you only need to store one letter
//-- char at = "@"
